# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Application

A web-based movie recommendation application designed to allow users to browse, search, and view details of movies.  
This project demonstrates best practices in frontend engineering, including authentication, state management, testing, and CI/CD deployment.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Provide users with personalized access to movie data.
- Display curated and searchable lists of movies from a public API.
- Deliver a clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface.
- Support continuous integration and deployment for scalability.

## ✅ Features

### 🔹 Data Access & Integration

- Fetch movie data from a public API (e.g., [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)).
- Cache frequently accessed data to improve performance.

### 🔹 Authentication

- User authentication via a preferred provider (e.g., Google, Auth0, Firebase).
- Restrict certain features (e.g., personalization) to logged-in users.

### 🔹 User Interface

- **Movie List View**: Browse movies with title, poster, and overview.
- **Movie Details View**: See detailed info (poster, description, cast, crew, ratings, etc.).
- **Search Functionality**: Search movies by keyword or title.
- **Pagination**: Smooth navigation for large datasets.
- **Loading States**: Show progress indicators while fetching data.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 🔹 State Management

- Manage movie list, search queries, and selected movie details.
- Implemented using a lightweight state management library or service.

### 🔹 Testing

- Unit tests for components, services, and API integrations.

### 🔹 Code Quality

- Written in **TypeScript**.
- Follows clean code principles for readability, maintainability, and scalability.

### 🔹 Deployment & Version Control

- Hosted on a public Git repository.
- Maintains **development** and **production** branches.
- Uses **conventional commits** for commit messages.
- Includes **CI/CD pipelines**:
  - Linting and unit tests run automatically.
  - Automatic deployment to a free-tier hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

## 📊 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Load movie lists within 2–3 seconds under normal network conditions.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable for future features like recommendations.
- **Security**: Secure authentication and API key management.
- **Maintainability**: Modular and documented codebase.
- **Usability**: Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

---

## 🚀 Optional / Future Enhancements

- Advanced recommendation engine based on user preferences.
- User profiles with saved favorites and personalization.
- UI animations and micro-interactions for a modern experience.
- Wireframes or Figma design documentation.
- Performance optimization (lazy loading, prefetching).
